# Password-Generator

Creating an application that can be used to generate a random password using JavaScript

## Discription

The task is to create an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code. The app will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The password can include a combination of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.

The application must:

- Generate a password when the button is clicked.

- Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

    - Length of password: At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    - Character types:
        - Lowercase
        - Uppercase
        - Numeric
        - Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

- Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
